          <li><strong>Collaborated</strong> with the <strong>QBE Insurance</strong> headquarters in Australia, where I
            worked closely with the <strong>ESB team</strong> and leveraged IBM Integration Bus (IIB) to <strong>achieve
              our project goals</strong>.</li>
          <li>Together, we successfully delivered <strong>multiple Production Enterprise Releases</strong>, ensuring
            seamless <strong>system
              integration</strong> and <strong>high-quality solutions</strong>.</li>
          <li>I earned a <strong>promotion</strong> to a higher position with increased responsibilities, which included
            assuming <strong>full ownership of a project</strong> that had previously been managed by my team.
            Additionally, I was
            <strong>entrusted</strong> with the task of providing <strong>knowledge transfer (KT)</strong> to my junior
            colleagues.
